# [optional footer(s)]


# fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates
#   with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
#
# feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this
#   correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).

#   build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:
#
# footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a
#   convention similar to git trailer format.
